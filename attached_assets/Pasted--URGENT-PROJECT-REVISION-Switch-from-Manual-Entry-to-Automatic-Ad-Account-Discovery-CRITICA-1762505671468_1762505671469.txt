**URGENT PROJECT REVISION: Switch from Manual Entry to Automatic Ad Account Discovery**

**CRITICAL ISSUE:**
The current implementation requires manual entry of Ad Account IDs. This is inefficient as the provided Access Token is already associated with a **Business Manager** or **User** that manages all required Ad Accounts.

**NEW CORE REQUIREMENT:**
The application must **automatically discover and list all managed Ad Accounts** linked to the configured Access Token and App ID/Secret, instead of relying on manual entry.

**Specific Tasks for Replit Agent:**

1.  **API Endpoint Change for Discovery:**
    * **Remove** the manual entry form and the `manage_accounts.php` file's reliance on manual input.
    * Modify `api.php` or create a new discovery function in `account_manager.php` to target the appropriate Facebook Marketing API endpoint for Ad Account discovery.
    * **Target Endpoint Example (Assuming User Access Token):**
        ```
        [https://graph.facebook.com/v19.0/me/adaccounts?fields=name,account_status,id](https://graph.facebook.com/v19.0/me/adaccounts?fields=name,account_status,id)
        ```
    * **Alternative (If using Business Manager Token):**
        ```
        [https://graph.facebook.com/v19.0/](https://graph.facebook.com/v19.0/)<BUSINESS_MANAGER_ID>/owned_ad_accounts?fields=name,account_status,id
        ```
    * **Action:** The PHP code must fetch the **ID (`act_<id>`)** and **Name** of all linked Ad Accounts.

2.  **Dynamic Account Listing & Switching:**
    * The fetched list of Ad Accounts must be **stored temporarily** (e.g., in a PHP session or a local file during development) to populate the account selector.
    * The `manage_accounts.php` or the main dashboard UI must display the **discovered list of Ad Accounts** (Name and ID).
    * Implement the switching mechanism so that when an account is selected, the **Dashboard** is dynamically populated with data **only** from the selected `act_<id>`.

3.  **Status Filtering:**
    * In the final display (both the account list and the campaign overview), ensure the **`account_status`** and **`campaign_status`** fields are fetched and used to visually indicate if an account or campaign is **Active, Disabled, Pending Review, etc.** (This aligns with the requirements seen in the uploaded screenshot).

**Start by modifying `account_manager.php` or `api.php` to show the necessary PHP `cURL` or API SDK code structure required to hit the `me/adaccounts` endpoint and parse the resulting list of Ad Account IDs and Names.**
