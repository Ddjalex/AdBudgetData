**Project Finalization: Total Allocated Budget Calculation Fix**

**Current Status:**
The "Employee Productivity Report" successfully filters entities by `created_time` and `effective_status='ACTIVE'`, and accurately groups data by Ad Account ID. However, the **Total Allocated Budget** column remains stuck at **$0.00**. This indicates that the advanced budget calculation logic previously requested is not yet implemented or is failing.

**CRITICAL FIX: Budget Calculation Implementation:**
The PHP code must be revised to correctly calculate the Total Allocated Budget for all created and Active Ad Sets/Ads by implementing the following logic:

1.  **Retrieve Necessary Data:** Ensure the API calls for Ad Sets and Ads are fetching the required fields: **`daily_budget`**, **`lifetime_budget`**, **`start_time`**, and **`end_time`**.

2.  **PHP Calculation Logic (Focus on `calculateTotalAllocatedBudget` function):**
    * For each Active entity (Ad Set or Ad) created in the time period, apply the following calculation:
        * **A. Lifetime Budget:** If the entity has a **`lifetime_budget`** value, use that value directly.
        * **B. Daily Budget Calculation:** If the entity has a **`daily_budget`** value:
            * **Calculate Duration:** Determine the number of days between the **`start_time`** and the **`end_time`** (inclusive). Ensure robust handling for date differences in PHP, considering edge cases where the `end_time` might be missing (e.g., set a large default duration if `end_time` is null, or skip calculation for safety).
            * **Calculate Total:** Total Allocated Budget for this entity = `daily_budget` $\times$ Duration (in days).

3.  **Currency Conversion:**
    * **Crucial:** All budget figures fetched from the Facebook API are typically in **cents** (smallest currency unit). The PHP code must divide the final calculated budget by **100** before aggregating the totals and displaying the result in the report table (e.g., $33900 becomes $339.00).

4.  **Aggregation:** The calculated totals from all Active, created entities must be correctly aggregated and stored against the respective **Ad Account ID**.

**Replit Agent Task:**

Provide the **updated PHP function** responsible for iterating through the Ad Set/Ad data and calculating the final `Total Allocated Budget`. The solution must specifically demonstrate:
* How the `start_time` and `end_time` strings are used to calculate the duration (in days).
* The application of the duration multiplication logic for `daily_budget`.
* The division by 100 for currency conversion before the final sum is displayed.

**Start by presenting the revised PHP code block for the budget processing loop.**
